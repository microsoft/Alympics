# K-Level Reasoning with Large Language Models

**K-Level Reasoning** is a a novel reasoning approach for LLMs, which adopts the perspective of rivals to recursively employ k-level thinking
based on available historical information. It significantly improves the strategic decision-making capability for LLM in dynamic, interactive, and competitive scenarios.

## Dynamic Strategic Reasoning with LLMs
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in complex reasoning tasks, their performance in dynamic, interactive, and competitive scenarios - such as business strategy and stock market analysis - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally explore the dynamic reasoning capabilities of LLMs for decision-making in rapidly evolving environments.

We introduce two game theory based pilot challenges that mirror the complexities of real-world dynamic decision-making. These challenges are well-defined, enabling clear, controllable, and precise evaluation of LLMs’ dynamic reasoning abilities.

**Guessing 0.8 of the Average**. It involves ten-round games, where each player selects a number between 1 to 100. The winner of each round is the player whose chosen number is closest to 80% of the average number picked by all players. This challenge mirrors the dynamics of market predictions, where players must anticipate collective market behavior. 

**Survival Auction Game**. Players bid in daily auctions to secure scarce living resources, balancing their health and finances to survive a 10-day period, simulating scenarios of resource scarcity and financial decision-making.

## K-Level Reasoning
K-level thinking is a recursive reasoning process. In first-level thinking, individuals react directly to the environment, akin to static reasoning. In second-level thinking, individuals take into account the first-level thinking of others, and so on and so forth.

We draw on this idea to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in dynamic challenges, and propose the “K-Level Reasoning”. This method involves recursively simulating the opponent’s behavior using available historical information, followed by predicting the optimal behavior based on the opponents’ behavior modeling.

Illustration of different methods in the Guessing 0.8 of the Average game. 

**Left**: In the Chain of Thought, the LLM outputs reasoning logic in a step-by-step format. However, the LLM demonstrates poor understanding of situations and prediction of opponents’ actions. 

**Middle**: In the Prediction Chain-of-Thought, with an explicit requirement to make predictions about rivals’ next moves, the LLM clearly divides the reasoning into prediction and reasoning phases. However, the predictions are still somewhat biased. 

**Right**: In the K-Level Reasoning, the LLM recursively predict rivals’ next moves with public historical information. Thank to a deeper strategic depth than rivals, the prediction and decision are more accurate.

## Contributions

- We study the dynamic reasoning capabilities of LLMs from a game theory perspective and introduce two pilot tasks. Both tasks mirror the complexities of real-world dynamic decision-making and are also well-defined for evaluating LLMs’ dynamic reasoning abilities.
- We propose a novel reasoning approach with LLMs - the “K-Level Reasoning” method. It integrates cognitive hierarchy theory into reasoning process, empowering LLMs to recursively predict and respond to the thoughts and actions of rivals in competitive and dynamic scenarios.

## Codes

### Guessing 0.8 of the Average

Play the game and record the results (using K-Level-Reasoning (kr) as the player and Direct (agnet) as the opponent as an example). The game log will be saved in the result folder by default.
```
cd G08A
python main.py  --player_strategy kr --computer_strategy agent --exp_num 1
```
Then, perform the calculation of player metrics, which will output the data for the player's `WinRate` and `AdaptionIndex`.

```
python evaluate.py --players kr --opponents agent
```

### SurvivalAuctionGame

Play the game and calculate metrics.
```
cd SAG

python main.py  --player_strategy kr --computer_strategy agent --exp_num 1

python evaluate.py --players kr --opponents agent
```
