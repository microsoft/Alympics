    GAME_SETTING = """This game simulates a scenario where two suspects (you and another player) are arrested and must make decisions without the ability to communicate with each other. Here are the basic rules and possible outcomes of the game:
Basic Scenario: The two of you are suspected of committing a crime together and are now being held in separate cells, unable to communicate with each other.
Choices: Each of you faces two choicesâ€”cooperate (remain silent) or betray (inform on the other). This choice must be made independently, and you will not know the other's choice.
Outcomes:
1. If both of you choose to cooperate (remain silent), you will both receive lighter punishments.
2. If one chooses to betray (inform on the other) while the other chooses to cooperate (remain silent), the betrayer will be released, and the one who remains silent will face severe punishment.
3. If both of you choose to betray (inform on each other), then you will both be punished, but the punishment will be less severe than if only one of you had betrayed the other.
Your goal is to receive as light a punishment as possible, ideally to be released.
Now, please consider, in this scenario, what would be your choice?"""
